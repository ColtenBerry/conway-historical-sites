# Team Contract

I, Elliot Allen, have taken on the role of Task Manager for our Conway Public Art app. I will be responsible for scheduling and organizing team meetings. In these meetings, I will make sure that each member of our team is making progress and on the right track to complete the app. To end the meetings, I am responsible for ensuring that every member of the team has something to be working on to make ample progress.

Beta Test Organizer : Sadie Lewis


Tucker Groves-Benedict : I will be working as a unit tester. My roll will be to look over our code and write unit tests so that we always know what parts of the 
code are functional and what parts of the code are not. I will focus on writing functional readable code so that our collaboration is easy. My job is also to make sure the rest of the team is keeping up with unit tests. I do not have to write all of them, but if no unit tests are written I have failed at my job.
