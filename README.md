# Team Contract

Task Manager : Elliot Allen

Client Interfacer : Mason Murphy

Unit Tester : Tucker Groves-Benedict

Integration Tester : Annabel Mehari

Beta Test Organizer : Sadie Lewis


Tucker Groves-Benedict : I will be working as a unit tester. My roll will be to look over our code and write unit tests so that we always know what parts of the 
code are functional and what parts of the code are not. I will focus on writing functional readable code so that our collaboration is easy. My job is also to make sure the rest of the team is keeping up with unit tests. I do not have to write all of them, but if no unit tests are written I have failed at my job.
